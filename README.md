## Running the App

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the app in development mode.

  - `App.jsx`: Main application component that renders all pages.
  - `main.jsx`: Entry point for the app.
  - `index.css`: Global styles for the app.

- **vite.config.js**: Configuration file for Vite.
- **eslint.config.js**: Configuration file for ESLint.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A next-generation, fast build tool for React applications.
- **CSS**: Styling for the web app (plain CSS used).
- **React Router**: For routing between different pages of the quiz.
- **react-gauge-chart**: Used for the gauge component to show the quiz score.

---

## API Integration

For the mock API, I have used **WireMock Cloud** to host mock APIs. This is used to simulate backend responses for the quiz. Since this is a mock API, no specific endpoints are listed, but it handles the quiz logic, including fetching quiz questions, simulating submitting answers and providing results.

## Development Notes

### Working with Vite

- Vite provides fast development build times and hot module replacement (HMR).
- The app is set up with JavaScript.
- All components are styled with plain CSS.

### Routing

- **React Router** has been used for navigation between pages like `HomePage`, `QuestionPage`, and `ResultPage`.

### Gauge Component

- The gauge chart showing the user's score is implemented using the **`react-gauge-chart`** library. It provides a visually appealing way to display scores.
